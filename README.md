Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide a systematic approach to speech signal enhancement through custom bandpass filtering. The implementation is based on a careful analysis of the original speech signal's characteristics and the identification of noise frequencies. Visualizations in both time and frequency domains guide the selection of filter parameters.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.

Usage
Open MATLAB and run the main.m script to execute the entire signal enhancement process.

View the visualizations and compare the original and filtered signals.

The filtered output will be saved as filtered_output.wav in the project directory.

Code Structure
main.m: Main script to execute the speech signal enhancement process.
my_bandpass_filter.m: Function for designing a custom bandpass filter.
voice.wav: Sample audio file for testing.
